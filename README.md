# 101 Visualization Exercises

> For our first visualization exercise, we're going to use our mind's eye, our seeing imagination. And as you close your physical eyelids, begin to see an ocean in your mind's eye. Visualize a vast ocean stretching for thousands of kilometers in all directions. On the surface, the waves are choppy, crackling with surf, and boiling with energy from the Sun, the wind, and the tides. And as you perceive this wide and deep ocean, turn your attention deeper, under the waves, sinking down. Notice how signs of wildlife start to show up as you sink deeper and deeper, jellyfish dancing in the rays of sunlight, seaweed floating peacefully as things get bluer and darker, quieter and quieter. And tune your antennae in to sense how all that energy from the waves feels farther and farther away, smaller. And really take in that things get slower and quieter the deeper down you go. And as the sound of the churning surf turns into a "wall" of sound so thick it feels solid, notice how peaceful everything starts to feel - feel yourself comforted by the quiet beneath the waves, the weight of the water, the still of the deep...

## What's this project all about?
- Lots of practice in making visualizations.
- The number one learning goal of completing these exercises is to equip users with applied knowledge, skills, and abilities in order to feel more confident approaching visualization tasks.

## The big ideas
- Lots and lots of practice with making figures, charting values, and creating useful data visualizations.
- Programming language (or platform) agnostic exercise prompts written in as natural language as possible to be useful to anybody wanting to practice making visualizations.
- Pre-done figures to demonstrate a desireable implementation for self-checks and reference.
- The exercise prompts and example figures form a prepared environment to assist self-directed experiential learning ( my take on a Montessori approach)
- Iterative/progressive activites in the exercises
    - Example:
        1. plot a scatterplot of x vs y.
        2. plot a scatterplot of x vs. y with a color for each category A.
        3. plot a scatterplot of x vs. y with a color for each category A with 4 subplots for each value of category B
- CSV or API data sources to help the language agnostic approach
