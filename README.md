# 101 Visualization Exercises

## What's this project all about?
- Lots of practice in making visualizations.
- The number one learning goal of completing these exercises is to equip users with applied knowledge, skills, and abilities in order to feel more confident approaching visualization tasks.

## The Big Ideas
- Lots and lots of practice with making figures, charting values, and creating useful data visualizations.
- Programming language (or platform) agnostic exercise prompts written in as natural language as possible to be useful to anybody wanting to practice making visualizations.
- Pre-done figures to demonstrate a desireable implementation for self-checks and reference.
- The exercise prompts and example figures form a prepared environment to assist self-directed experiential learning ( my take on a Montessori approach)
- Iterative/progressive activites in the exercises
    - Example:
        1. plot a scatterplot of x vs y.
        2. plot a scatterplot of x vs. y with a color for each category A.
        3. plot a scatterplot of x vs. y with a color for each category A with 4 subplots for each value of category B
- CSV or API data sources to help the language agnostic approach
