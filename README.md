# 101 Visualization Exercises

> For our first visualization exercise, we're going to use our mind's eye, our seeing imagination. And as you close your physical eyelids and being to see things in your mind's eye, visualize a great big gigantic ocean stretching for thousands of kilometers in all directions. On the surface, the waves are choppy, crackling with surf, and boiling with energy from the Sun, the wind, and the tides. And as you perceive this vast ocean, turn your attention deeper, under the waves, sinking down. Begin to notice how signs of wildlife start to show up as you sink deeper and deeper, jellyfish dancing in the rays of sunlight, seaweed floating peacefully as things get bluer and darker, quieter and quieter. And tune your antennae in and notice how all that energy from the waves above feels farther and farther away, smaller. And really take in that things are slower and quieter the deeper down you go. And as the sound of the churning surf turns into a "wall" of sound so thick it feels solid, notice how peaceful everything starts to feel...

## Big Idea
- Lots of practice iwth 
- Iterative/progressive activites in the exercises
    - plot a scatterplot of x and y.
    - plot a scatterplot of x vs. y with a hue for each category z.
- CSV or API data sources

## Vision
- Programming language (or platform) agnostic exercise prompts written in as natural language as possible.
- Pre-done figures to demonstrate a desireable implementation for self-checks and reference.
